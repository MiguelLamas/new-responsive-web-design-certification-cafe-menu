Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

CSS tells the browser how to display your webpage. You can use CSS to set the color, font, size, and other aspects of HTML elements.

In this course, I practiced CSS by designing a menu page for a cafe webpage, completing all 91 challenges on freeCodeCamp.
